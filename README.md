# Bootstrap-Portfolio
*A Bootstrap-powered portfolio.*

## Overview
The development of Frontend Frameworks and CDNs has changed the landscape of web development and the emergence of Bootstrap 4 takes that to a whole new level. Having already done my portfolio, this is an attempt to revamp it using Bootstrap.

## Description
This application is developed to using Bootstrap 4 to demonstrate the quality and value it brings to the table. The tools, utilities and vast wealth of resources it has makes it one of the most popular in the industry. What better way is there to demonstrate this than to showcase my work using these very framework. As the name implies Bootstrap Portfolio is a Repo setup to showcase a cross section of my web applications. The website contains my biography, qualifications and other useful information with a contact form should you wish to get in get in touch. This link with take you there. 

## Usage
This Repo is made up of the core files and folders related to the task. It contains a folder with an image of the end product and I have added comments to all the relevant sections of the code, highlighting key areas and further explain the design.  The content comprise only that related to the design and I have used 2 CSS files to simplify and further streamline the design. The UI of the webpage is laid out to maximise the UX of every visitor, such that the need for further guidelines becomes superfluous. Click here to check it out.
